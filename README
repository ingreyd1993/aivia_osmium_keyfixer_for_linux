USAGE: 

***These instructions must be executed each time your keyboard id changes
(such as when you restart your computer, when you unplug your keybaord,
potentially when you restart Xserver.)

1) Run input, and find the id number for Osmium Interface.

2) Edit aivia_osmium_keyfixer.py and plug the id into "keyboarddeviceid" on
code line #23.

3) Save aivia_osmium_keyfixer.py

4) Run "python3 aivia_osmium_keyfixer.py" in a terminal. Detatch it, or
   minimize it, and then forget about it. 

Q&A:

Q: Why is this program not more robust? Why is it such a mess?
A: I originally wrote it up in about 20 minutes for my own personal use while
   playing games so that I wouldnt lose response from the keyboard anymore 
   whenever the Aivia key or one of the 5 hotkeys were pressed on the keybaord.
   It was never designed for public use, but I figure if others can get use
   out of it, I will release it as is.

TODO:
   - write code to auto detect the id number of the Osmium Interface from xinput
   - total basic clean up of code (stick it in functions, comment it, clean up
     other nasty stuff about it, etc.
